# Final Report
This folder contains the final report and supporting quarto r markdown file. We have used ``pdf`` as the render format. 

To render ``Report.qmd`` you would need a Tex compiler, ideally TinyTex. <br>
To install TinyTex follow these instructions:
- Go to Code -> Open Terminal at File Location
- Run ``quarto install tinytex``
